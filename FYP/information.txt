Natural language processing is a form of artificial intelligence that helps computers read and respond by simulating the 
human ability to understand everyday language. Many organizations use NLP techniques to optimize customer support, 
improve the efficiency of text analytics by easily finding the information they need, and enhance social media monitoring.
 For example, banks might implement NLP algorithms to optimize customer support; a large consumer products brand might 
combine natural language processing and semantic analysis to improve their knowledge management strategies and social 
media monitoring.


We describe the design and use of the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, an (able to be made longer or more complex) pipeline that
 provides core natural language analysis. This toolkit is quite widelyused,both in 
the research NLP community and also among commercial and government users of open sourceNLP technology. We suggest that 
this follows from a simple, friendly design, plain/honest/easy(connecting points/ways of interacting with something), 
including strong and healthy and goodquality analysis parts/pieces, and not needing/ordering use of a large amount of 
connectedbaggage.
